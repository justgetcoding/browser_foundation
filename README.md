# Browser Foundation
Common boilerplate code I am using that is ready for the browser.
Suitable for pens, fiddles, and plunks, or other use.

Not intended for production and not looking to change the world.  Just some common boilerplate I was rebuilding again and again.

### Development

     npm install

To set off the source build

     npm run build

### Run Samples
You can use something like http-server to quickly test out the samples in samples/math or samples/task
